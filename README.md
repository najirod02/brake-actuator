# Brake actuator

This project aims to test both an incremental magnetic encoder and a stepper motor using the STM32 Nucleo F446RE board.

## Encoder
For the encoder, only the A and B pins are needed, in addition to ground and VCC.

- Channel A (pin 3) is connected to pin PA0.

- Channel B (pin 5) is connected to pin PA1.

- The I pin can be used for detecting a complete revolution but is not required for the basic functionality.

In this implementation, a signed counter is used to allow for both positive and negative values, unlike the standard unsigned counter typically used with HAL.

## Step motor
To control the stepper motor, a driver requiring only 3 pins is used:
- Enable as pin PC0
- Step as pin PC1
- Dir as pin PC2

To move the motor, another timer is used, allowing for control of the stepper motorâ€™s movements velocity.

At the moment each step should take 1ms meaning that to move of 1cm it is required 1 second. This movement is slow but can be modified whenever we are sure that the actual implementation works.
